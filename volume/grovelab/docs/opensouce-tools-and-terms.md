This allows you to provide content to your users with high end performance.

What is **Redis** ? Remote Directory server, It is in memory key-value data storing (data structure server), This provides high speed performance, can be used as a real data storing and caching. Data is persistent there for nothing is lost after restarts.

What is **Solr** ? It is an advanced full text search engine. It is great for load balancing to improve performance by indexing the search text. Elastic Search is the most popular text search engine, second by Solr.

What is **Graphite** ? Graphite collects data not for monitoring but used for analyzing and viewing.

What is **Carbon** ? Carbon stores the Graphite configuration.It handles data sent over by other processes that collect and transmit statistics.

What is **Monite** ? Monit is a monitoring tool which can be plugged into graphite.

What is **Kibana** ? Kabana is a web application that allows one to build flexible dashboards. This can source data from ElasticSearch. Grafana is forked from Kibana.

What is **StatsD** ? StatsD is a daemon that listens for metrics sent over UDP. The data is sent to external services for graphing.

What is **Mesosphere** ? It is a Data Center Operating System. It gathers the specified amount of computer nodes to be used as one cluster. The amount of nodes can be scaled with a single command line. It allows you to deploy applications fast and effortlessly without you having to specify the node as it automatically handle your application resource consumption across the nodes.
